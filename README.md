_Still not ready for others to use yet. I have finished my POC that parsed two different sets of CSV and that worked now I'm working on converting the POC code into a more stable, well designed codebase_

# CSV Converter
The goal of this project is to parse CSV file(s), create databases based on the data in the files and create a RESTFul API to serve the 
data.  If you are curious about what my plans are or what I am currently working on check out my [trello board](https://trello.com/b/1j5eExND/csv2api)
